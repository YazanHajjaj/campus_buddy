# Phase 12 — Localization Quality Report (Mahmoud)

## Status
- Keys available: ❌ (waiting for localization_keys.dart)
- Base English template (en.json) available: ❌ (waiting)
- Turkish translation started: ❌
- Arabic translation started (optional): ❌

## QA Checklist (use when en.json exists)
- [ ] Every key exists in en.json (no missing base strings)
- [ ] No duplicate keys
- [ ] No inconsistent naming (auth.signIn vs auth.sign_in)
- [ ] Strings are clear and short (avoid long sentences)
- [ ] Error messages are friendly and consistent
- [ ] Placeholders are consistent (e.g., "{name}", "{count}")
- [ ] UI-fit risks flagged (long Turkish strings)

## Translation Plan (when unblocked)
1. Copy keys from en.json into tr.json
2. Translate English → Turkish (don’t change keys)
3. Optional: copy keys into ar.json (future)
4. Report long strings to Nour for layout fixes
