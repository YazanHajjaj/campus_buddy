# Phase 11 — Notification Privacy Notes (Mahmoud)

## Rules
- Do not include sensitive data in push payloads
- Avoid full chat message content in notifications
- Show context, not content (ex: "New message received", not the message body)

## Rationale
Keeps push notifications safe even if device notifications are visible on lock screen.
